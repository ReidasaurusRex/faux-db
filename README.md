# Faux Users DB

The goal of this lab was to begin to understand the concept of adding and storing information. Rather than use a database, an array was used, and user input was then pushed into the array. A map of hashes was also used for a more interesting way to access the information of the array, allowing me to select based upon ID rather than array index.
